# Multilayer Perceptron from scratch using NumPy.


This work is intended purely for understanding purpose only. All the codes are written in Python with the help of NumPy. Tensorflow is used to import the MNIST dataset.

A pdf file is also included to aid with the understanding of the algorithm.

Have fun learning!
